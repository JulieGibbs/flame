Using this git diff of a typical ${file} in a React Native ${currentVersion} app being upgraded to ${targetVersion}:

\`\`\`
${diff}
\`\`\`

Convert this file, ${localFile}, from React Native ${currentVersion} to React Native ${targetVersion}, using the git diff
as a guide for what changes to make, keeping in mind that this file has further customizations that should be kept the same
except where the diff matches against specific code in the file. The file currently looks like this:

\`\`\`
${sourceFileContents}
\`\`\`

Return just the converted file only. Keep the target file as close to the original as possible, while applying
the changes from the git diff. Treat "..." in the diff as if it is a placeholder for existing code that should
not be removed or changed.
