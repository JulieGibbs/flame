    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    * If the existing file has modifications and the diff doesn't apply cleanly, then figure out how to apply the diff to the modified file.
    * Intelligently determine what needs to change to capture the spirit of the change.
    * Bias toward keeping existing modifications to the existing code, except for things that are specifically called out as needing to be changed in the diff.
    * Match the style of the existing code, including indentation, quotation style, spacing,
    and line breaks.
    * Make sure to properly make changes to code comments as well.
    * Make sure to make all the changes in the diff that apply to this file.
    * When a comment is marked as deleted in the diff, make sure to delete that comment in the file too.
    * If no changes are needed, just say "None needed" and don't change the file.
